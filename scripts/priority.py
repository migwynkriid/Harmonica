    Set high priority for the current process on Windows only.
    
    This function attempts to elevate the process priority of the bot
    to improve performance, particularly for audio processing tasks.
    It only works on Windows systems and sets the process to HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS,
    which is the highest priority that can be set without administrator privileges.
    
    The function logs the priority change if successful, or logs an error
    if the operation fails.
